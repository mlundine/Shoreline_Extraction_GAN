# Shoreline_Extraction_GAN

Generating binary land vs. water masks from coastal RGB imagery using pix2pix and cycle-GAN.

This repo will contain the following:
1. Code to help with setting up the training data for either of these image-to-image translation GANs.
2. Code to train both models.
3. Code to run the models.
4. Code to process the results and extract shorelines into GIS format.
5. Trained models for Delmarva's coast.
